### Complementary Article

This Sample App implements the approach mentioned in my Medium article
at: https://medium.com/@callmeryan/changing-the-android-app-icon-programmatically-c913550330d

### The Underlying Working Principle

We can create multiple launcher icons by declaring `activity-alias` elements
in` AndroidManifest.xml`. The effect of changing the app icon is achieved by disabling the current
one and enabling a new one. While some say this does not work with things like crashlytics, deep
link, etc., indeed this is how Reddit implements this feature in their Android App.

### Requirement
